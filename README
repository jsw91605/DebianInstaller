DESCRIPTION
===========
These set of scripts can be used to install debian on android.

DEPENDENSIES
============
On host machine:
debootstrap (install for instance with apt-get install debootstrap)

On android device:
Must be rooted
Busybox must be installed

INSTALLATION
============
First clone this repository to your host machine:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ppareit/DebianInstaller.git

Now enter the scripts directory:

    $ cd DebianInstaller/scripts

First create an image on the host machine:

    $ sudo ./createimage.sh

Now push the image to the android device (make sure adb is connected):

    $ ./pushimage.sh

Everything is now installed.

# TODO: the next part could be automated with a script

You can proceed on the android device by starting up
a terminal emulator or by logging in to the shell from adb:

    $ adb shell

Now will we login for the first time. Do the following:

    $ su -
    # ch2debian
    # debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage  # TODO: check, not sure if this was the command used
    # exit
    # ch2debian
    # adduser username
    # addgroup --gid 3003 inet
    # usermod -G inet -a username
    # echo 'deb http://ftp.COUNTRY.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
    # apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
    # su - username
    $

Now everytime you want to chroot to your debian, start a terminal and run

    $ ch2debian  # TODO: check, can this be made to start as user (SUID?)

HACKING
=======
These set of scripts work for me, but they might need some more work.
Make your modifications and run

     $ git diff

to send me a patch. Even beter, fork this project on github and send
me a pull request!

TODO
====
* post installation script (second stage of bootstrap and add user)
* make one controlling script
* make scripts take options
* put this all in an installable .apk package
